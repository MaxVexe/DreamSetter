# DreamSetter


DreamSetter is my personal Project, aimed at simulating a website designed to oversee users' dreams and goals. In its current state of development, the project encompasses the creation of user accounts, including specialized accounts with special permissions. Users have the option to either establish a new account or access administrative privileges by logging in with appropriate credentials. My project roadmap involves the integration of a database to securely store all user-generated information.
